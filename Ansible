** Ansible : Ansible is an open source IT automation engine that automates provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, 
             orchestration, and many other IT processes. Ansible is a push based Configuration management and agentless means Configuration mgmt server will
             initiate the communication to the nodes. 
 -- Agentles means : No extra software/package runs on node or target machines only SSH is needed.

** Playbooks : Series of tasks that serve a goal, A structured YAML file in Ansible that contains one or more plays. Each play maps a group of hosts to tasks,
               using modules, roles, or custom logic to achieve a desired state.

** Handlers and Notify : Handlers are perticular task that executes when trigged by the notify module

** Configuration Management : Configuration Management is an automated process that ensures the configuration of these environments is optimal.

** Adhoc Commands : Ad -Hoc commands are commands which can be Run individually to perform quick functions

** Ansible Module : a reusable, standalone script that Ansible executes on target systems to carry out automation tasks like installing packages, 
                    managing files, configuring services, or handling cloud resources.
   1. Core module : : Core modules are the modules that Ansible itself always includes and maintains.
   2. Custom module :  Script you write that Ansible executes on managed nodes to perform specialized tasks.(commonly in Python, but can be in any language 
                      that outputs is in JSON). Examples - apt, yum, copy, user, package, service, ping


**Callback plugins : Callback plugins are can be used to perfoem a wide range of tasks, such as sending notifications, 
                     logging events, even modyfying the playbooks behaviour
   --Types-
     1. Logging Plugin
     2. Notification Plugin
     3. Customization Plugin
     4. Debugging Plugin


** Ansible Roles : a predefined directory structure containing tasks, variables, files, templates, and handlers that encapsulate a specific function

    1. Default– it stores the data about role/ application default variables example if you want to run to port 80 or 8080 then variables needs to define in this path.
    2. Files– it contains files made to transferred to the remote VM (static files)
    3. Handlers– They are triggers or task we can segregate all the handlers required in Playbook.
    4. Meta– this directory content files that establish rolls dependencies example- author name, supported platform, dependencies if any.
    5. Task– it contains all the task that is normally in the Playbook for example- installing packages and copies files etc.
    6. Vars– Variables for the role can be specified in this directory and used in your configuration files both wars and Default stores variables.

** Ansible Galaxy : Ansible Galaxy is essentially a large public repository of Ansible roles.

** Ansible Vault : Allows u to keep sensitive data such as a passwords or keys in encrypted files rather than plain text.

** Ansible Tower : We can use ansible tower to schedule jobs that run a playbook.

** Patching.yml : Patching refers the process of updating software, OS or firmware to fix security bugs or other isssues.

** Disaster Recovery (DR activity) : It is a process to restore critical business operations and IT systems after a event
