** Jenkins : (CI/CD tool)
            Jenkins is an open source automation server which enables to developers, testers, devops to build, test and deploy their softwares.

** Jenkins file path : var/lib/jenkins

** Plugins : It is a additional code to provide additional functionality to jenkins

** How to install new plugins
  1. Go to jenkins setting / plugins / available plugins (search and install plugin ex. docker)
  2. need to restart jenkins when new plugins installed

** Which plugin is use to take backup for jenkins
----> ThinBackup plugin

** No of executers = 2 means ---> We can run 2 jobs parallely

** How to integrate jenkins with AWS
----> 1. Adding access and secret key
      2. IAM Role
      3. AWS Credential plugin

** Triggers : Set up automated actions that start your build based on specific events, like code changes or scheduled times.

1. Trigger builds remotely : allows jobs to be started from outside Jenkins (via URL, API, or token) without manually clicking Build Now.
2. Build after other projects are build : a Jenkins trigger that runs a job automatically after designated upstream jobs complete.
3. Build Periodically :
    refers 5 star(*****) strategy in Jenkins
   1. * --> Minute - Minutes within hour
   2. * --> Hour - Hour of the day
   3. * --> DOM - Day of the month
   4. * --> Month - The Month(1-12)
   5. * --> DOW - Day of the week(0-7)

4. GitHub hook trigger fot GitSCM polling : lets Jenkins start a build automatically when GitHub sends a webhook about repository changes,
                                            instead of Jenkins periodically polling GitHub.
5. POLL SCM : Jenkins trigger that schedules regular checks of the source code repository, starting a build if changes are detected.


** Jenkins Master Slave Architecture:

1. Jenkins master : It handles a number of tasks that include but are not limited to scheduling build jobs, recording and presenting build results, dispatching builds to
                    slaves for execution, monitoring all the slaves offline as well as online, and others. Master Jenkins is capable of directly executing build jobs.
2. Jenkins Slave : The Jenkins server follows the requests of the Jenkins master and is compatible with all operating systems. Building jobs dispatched by the master 
                   are executed by the slave. The project can be suitably configured to choose a specific slave machine. 

** How to restart jenkins server
  --> in url ex. 10.10.10.106:8080/restart----->just need to enter /restart jenkins will restart.

** Jenkins Pipeline (Groovy Format)

         1. Scripted Pipeline- A Jenkins pipeline defined in Groovy code with full programmatic control and flexibility.

Comp use 2. Declarative Pipeline- A Jenkins pipeline defined in a structured, predefined syntax that is easier to read and maintain.


Sample Ex-

pipeline {
  agent any ---------->>run the pipeline on any available agent (node) in the Jenkins environment.
    stages {
         stage ('build') {
           steps {
             echo 'this is build stage'
             }
           }
         stage ('build') {
           steps {
             echo 'this is build stage'
             }
           }
         stage ('build') {
           steps {
             echo 'this is build stage'
             }
           }
