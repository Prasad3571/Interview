**Docker : Docker is an open source centralized platform designed to create deploy and run actions.
**Microservices on container : Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software developmentwhere software is composed
                             of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.
**Docker Daemon : Docker Daemon/Docker engine manages containers, Images and operations.
**Docker client : Docker client is a command line interface that allows user to interact with docker deamon.
**Docker Host : The docker host is the machine that runs the docker daemon and executes container.
**Docker Registry : Docker registry is a repositoy that stores docker images.
**Docker Image : A docker image is a lightweight, Readonly template that contains the application code, dependencies and configurations.
**Docker Container : this is a Running version of docker image, A container is an isolated environment for your code.
**Docker Compose : To share multicontainer docker applications, Compose file is in yaml, yml format

**Docker Networking : Docker networking is a passage through which all the isolated container communicate.
1. Bridge network(Comp use) : It is the default network driver for a container, u use this networks when your applications is running on standalone containers, 
                              Multiple containers communicating with the same docker host.
   cmd-1  : docker network connect my-bridge <container_name> ----> To add container in my-bridge network
    cmd-2 : docker inspect my-bridge ---> To show details of my-bridge network.

2. Host
3. Overlay
4. None
5. Macvlan



** How to mount volume into the container : docker run -d --mount source=myvol,target=/tmp/data ubuntu


**Docker file instructions (GO language format)

1. FROM : Every docker file starts with FROM cmd for base image.

2. MAINTAINER : Author/Owner or Description of your image

3. COPY : It will copy files and directories from host machine to the container.

4. ADD : ADD cmd will copy files remotely from url.

5. EXPOSE : EXPOSE cmd use To expose the port of the container or to open perticular port for container.

6. WORKDIR : This cmd is similar as cd cmd, If u mention any path after WORKDIR, the shell will be changed into directory.

7. RUN : RUN cmd is used to run any shell cmds and these cmds will run on top of your base image, RUN cmd will execute during the build time of your image.
Example- RUN apt update -y && apt install nginx -y

8. ENTRYPOINT : The first cmd that will execute in the container is ENTRYPOINT. The ENTRYPOINT will execute befor CMD cmd. When u want your container to be executable 
                use ENTRYPOINT. 
Example- ENTRYPOINT ["installation.sh"] 

9. CMD : The CMD cmd doesn't execute during the build time. It will execute after creation of the container. There can be only one cmd in dockerfile. If u mentioned multiple 
CMD cmds then last one will be executed.
Example- CMD [mongodb]



**Docker Commands : 
1. To see all images present in your local machine
   # docker images
2. To find out images in docker hub
   # docker search Jenkins
3. To download image from docker hub to local machine.
   # docker pull Jenkins
4. To give name to container
   #docker run -it –name container_name ubuntu bin/ bash
5. To check service is start or not
   #service docker status
6. To start container
   #docker start container_name
7. To go inside container
   #docker attach container_name
8. To see all containers
   #docker ps -a
9. To see only running containers
   #docker ps
10. To stop container
   #docker stop container_name
11. To delete container
   #docker rm container_name
