** Maven Lifecycle or Goals

1. Validate – validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
2. Compile – compile the source code of the project
3. Test – test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
4. package – take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
5. Verify – run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
6. install – install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
7. deploy – done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

** Maven commands 

1. mvn clear package : clear existing workspace and perform goal validate to packaging.
2. mvn clear install : perform goal validate to install.
