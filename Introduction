I am Prasad Gorakshnath Shinde, an AWS Cloud & DevOps Engineer with 4+ years of
experience in designing, automating, and optimizing cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines.
My expertise spans Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and a wide range of AWS services
including EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, RDS, and CloudWatch.
Currently, I am engaged in a GE Healthcare (UK) project, where I architect and implement cloud
automation solutions and CI/CD pipelines to support mission-critical healthcare applications.
My key contributions include:
• Improving deployment speed by 40% through optimized Jenkins pipelines.
• Reducing annual cloud costs by 20% with efficient resource provisioning via Terraform.
• Ensuring 100% compliance with healthcare industry standards by enforcing IAM
policies, MFA, and robust monitoring with CloudWatch.
Prior to my DevOps career, I worked as a Windows Administrator, gaining strong foundations in
system administration and troubleshooting. Since then, I have specialized in building secure,
scalable, and cost-efficient cloud solutions.
I hold multiple AWS certifications (Solutions Architect Associate & Professional, DevOps
Engineer Professional, Cloud Practitioner) and actively contribute to the AWS User Group,
mentoring aspiring engineers in community tech programs. Alongside technical expertise, I
bring strong soft skills in communication, collaboration, leadership, and problem-solving,
making me effective in both technical and cross-functional team environments.
