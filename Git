**Version control- Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

1. Centralized Version control System- In Centralized version control there in only one repositoy which is available remotely, If the remote repo crashed, there is a chances 
                                       to remove all date from remote repo because of we dont have any backup of these repo.
2. Distributed Version control System- This is the advance Version control system, here we have 2 repoitory one is avalable in user local machine and another one is available
               remotely, If the remote repo crashed, we have backup of these repo which is availble in our local machine repo. these is a main benifit of Distributed Version
               control System.


** Git Commands 

1. git clone <repo_url>  --->To clone data from remote repo to local repo
2. git add . ---> To add all files in staging area
3. git commit -m "Commit_msg" ---> -m for message, To commit data in local repo
4. git push <repo_url> ---> To push data frol local repo to Remote repo

**Git Branch : We are not allowing any developer/devops to do directly changes into main/master branch. So we nned to create our feature branch first and then do changes,
             If our code is correct and approved by higher management then we can merge this code into master/main branch.
             NOTE : We need to mention Request or Change ID as a feature branch name.

** Git Branch commands :

1. git checkout -b <new_branch_name> ----> To create and switch into new branch
2. git branch -D <branch_name> ---> To delete branch
3. git log ---> To check all commits with 40 digit alphanumeric checksum unique number
4. git log --oneline ---> To check commits in oneline
5. git branch ---> To list all branches
6. git switch <branchname> / git checkout <branchname> ---> To switch branch

** Git Merge : Merge in git allows you to join two or more developement work created using git branch into single branch(main branch)
    NOTE - Pull request and approved merge request always raised and approved through GUI console.
** Merge Conflict : A merge conflict in github happens when git can't automatically combile changes from different branches due to overlapping edits. which branch has conflict
                    that must be resolved.

** How to resolve conflict 
  1. Click on resolve conflict over github
  2. Make changes
    <<<<<<< --->Remove This
    >>>>>>> ---> Remove This
  3. Click on Mark as resolved
  4. Click on commit merge
  5. Now status is - NO CONFLICT WITH BASE BRANCH
  6. Click on Merge pull request/Confirm merge
  7. Now we can see changes reflected in our base master or main branch.

** git clone : To Copy repoitory from remote repo to local repo
** git fork : Copy repositoy from one account to another account
** git push : Push the code from local repo to remote repo
** git pull : Git pull on the other hand brings the copy of remote directory changes into working directory.
** git fetch : git fetch cmd fetches all the changes from the remote repo to local repo without bringing the changes into the working directory.

          git pull = git fetch + git merge

** git stash : Stash is a temporary storage in git, For eq- If u are working on some task, in between your manager ask u to work on another task, So that time u can temp
 hold or stash the current task and complete manager task first and after that u can access our stashed task and u can work continue.

** stash commands 

1. git stash ---> stash your current file
2. git stash apply 'stash@{0}'---> To access stashed data into workspace
3. git stash list ---> To check stash list
4. git stash show ---> To check stashed file data
5. git stash clear ---> To clear all stashed files
5. git stash drop stash@{0} ---> To delete specific stash file

** git reset : git reset is a command that moves your current branch to a different commit, allowing you to undo changes.

1. git reset --soft <commit>  ---> code revert back from local repo to index(stagging area)
2. git reset --mixed <commit>  ---> code revert back from local repo to working area (workspace)
3. git reset --hard <commit>  ---> code will be removed from every area, commit undo without commit ID.


** git revert : code will be removed directly after commit, commit undo with new commit ID.

** git rebase : Rebase is a linear merge, for example- We have created feature branch and in feature branch we have 3 commits, after that u want to rebase in that case feature
                branch commits added as a seprate 3 commits in main branch.

** git tag : In git tag means group of commits, Mostly it is used to create, list and delete commits in the repo.

** .gitignore : In some repo we need to create .gitignore file and we can specify the ignore words, filename or extensuions, So user uable to commit the same data in repo.
    Example- 1. log/
             2. *.ninja/
             3. *.debug/
             4. *.svclog/

** git cherry pick : Cherry picking in the git stands for applying some commit form one branch into another branch. Incase u made a mistake and commited a change into
                     the wrong branch, bot do not want to merge the whole branch u can pick specific commit and merge it.

** git hooks : git hoks are script that git executes before or after events such as commit, push and pull. this script allow u to customize and automate certain task in your
               git workflow.
   Example - pre-commit, pre-push, post-push
