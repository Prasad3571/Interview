** Terraform (Infrastructure as Code) : Terraform is an infrastructure as a code tool that enable u to safely provision and manage infa in any cloud.
   Language : Hashicorp Language(HCL)

** terraform.lock.hcl : This file created after we run terraform init, this is auto generated by terraform, This file contains
                        a record of exact version of providers and modules used in your terraform configuration.

** Terraform.tfstate file : Once we run the terraform apply cmd, that time terraform.tfstate file will be created and the actual content of this file is a JSON 
                            foramtted mapping of the resources that is defined in the configuration. if anyone deleted this tfstate file, in this case terraform memory 
                            will be lost, terraform forgetten all resources which is made so terraform try to create those all resources again, So we can prevent this,
                            we can store this tfstate file in s3 bucket and if we can more secure this file then we can also use dynamoDB table to lock this file,
                            if anyone woking on infra this file is locked for the same time.

** terraform provider : Terraform provider uses to interface between terraform engine and the supported cloud platform.

** variables.tf : We declares input variables for our Terraform project. Variable names, types, default values, and descriptions.
--Example-

variable "aws_region" {
  description = "AWS region to deploy resources"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"
}


** terraform.tfvars : Provides actual values for the variables declared in variables.tf. 
--Example-

aws_region     = "ap-south-1"
instance_type  = "t3.medium"



-- Terraform Commands : 

1. terraform init : The terraform init cmd initializes a working directory containing configuration files and installs plugins for required provider.
2. terraform validate : The terraform validate cmd validates the configuration files in a inventory.
3. terraform plan : The terraform plan cmd creates an execution plan which lets u preview the changes.
4. terraform apply : The terraform apply cmd executes the action proposed in a terraform plan to create, update and destroy infrastructure.
5. terraform destroy : Actually the terrafrom destroy cmd not using in company. because this cmd terminates resources managed by your terraform project, 
                       If we have received any request to delete any resource then we can comment it out this resource in main.tf file

** Meta Arguments : Meta arguments in terraform are special arguments that can be used with resource blockand modules to control their behavior or influence
                    in the infra provisioning process.

1. count.tf : Allows you to create multiple instances of resources based on a count value. It is useful when you want to create multiple similar resources
              without duplicating the configuration block.

resource "aws_instance" "example"
     count = 3
     ami   = "ami-id"
     instance_type = "t2.micro"

     tag = {
       name = "instance-${count.index + 1}"
     }
}

2. for_each.tf : Help in creating multiple instances of defined configuration. It also provides us with the flexibility of dynamically setting the attributes
                 for each resource.

locals {
ec2 = {
“vm1” = { instance_type = “t2.micro”, ami_id = “ami-0c7217cdde317cfec”, name = “My-EC2-1”},
“vm2” = { instance_type = “t2.small”, ami_id = “ami-079db87dc4c10ac91”, name = “My-EC2-2” },
“vm3” = { instance_type = “t2.medium”, ami_id = “ami-0c7217cdde317cfec”, name = “My-EC2-3”}
}
}

resource “aws_instance” “my_ec2” {
for_each = local.ec2
instance_type = each.value.instance_type
ami = each.value.ami_id

tags = {
name= “Instance-$(each.value.name)”
}

}

3. depends_on : Allows you to define explicit dependencies between resources. it takes a list of resource dependencies, and terraform ensures that resources
                are created or destroyed in the correct order based on dependencies.

resource “aws_instance” “webserver” {
# info
depends_on = [aws_security_group.web.sg]
}


** map.tf : The string map.tf is a common filename convention in terraform for a file that defines a map variable or local value, typically used in conjunction
            with a meta argument like for-each. It is not a meta-argument itself



** Variables :

1. Local Variables –

locals {
instance_type = “t2.micro”
}

resource “aws_instance” “example” {
instance_type = local.instance_type
# Rest of config
}

---------------------------

** Input Variables –

2.String Variables –

String variables are used to represent text values.

variable “instance_type” {
type = string
default = “t2.micro”
}
resource “aws_instance” “example” {
instance_type = var.instance_type
# Rest of config
}

-----------------------------

3. Number Variables -

Number variables are used to represent numerical values.

variable “instance_count” {
type = number
default = 5
}
resource “aws_instance” “example” {
count = var.instance_count
# Rest of config
}

----------------------------

4. List Variables –
List Variables represent a list sequence of values of a particular type and are used to create multiple resources or provide numerous arguments for a resource.

variable “subnet_ids” {
type = list(string)
default = [“subnet-abcde012”, “subnet-bcde012a”, “subnet-fghi345a”]
}
resource “aws_instance” “example” {
count = length(var.subnet_ids)
subnet_id = var.subnet_ids[count.index]
# Rest of code
}

-------------------------------

5. Map Variables-
can create a collection of key-value pairs. They are used to dynamically set arguments based on a specific key.

variable “tag_values” {
description = “Map of tags to assign to the resources”
type = map(string)
default = {
Environment = “Development”
Team = “DevOps”
batch = “25”
Class = “Young minds”
}
}

resource “aws_instance” “example” {
ami = “ami-0c94855ba95c574c8”
instance_type = “t2.micro”
tags = var.tag_values

}
